Pretty much a way for all of us to patch things up

Check Report.yml 

The report has my initial findings coupled with Achraf's, this might be a good starting point to patch things up, you can either remove the issue or cross it when finished, and ofc add more when found

You can even make the markdown contain those fixes and cross them as you go if you feel like it
