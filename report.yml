    ft_isdigit :
        - The subject asks to write a function that takes a character but the prototype takes an int; (taking an int will implicitly typecast the character thus making the ex meaningless -ascii_character has typecasting so the student should be aware of it-) and one digit is missing (0).
        - Missing example.
    ft_isconsonent : 
        - The is_consonant.c file does not specify if "y" is a consonant, might cause issues.

    ft_mod : 
        - Function ft_mod is declared as return type void in correction file.
        - Generator file has a run test function that takes a divisor and a value, the test passes strings like "42" "5" as one argument
        - When passing the assignment i've encountered an error while perfoming the grading job, the error was "[Errno 2] No such file or directory 'ref_exe'", i couldn't recreate it later on.
