Write a function that takes two parameters:

A pointer to an integer (int *ptr).
An integer (int number).

This function will update the contents of the pointer by calculating the square root of the integer received as the second parameter.
    - If the square root is an integer, store the result in *ptr. 
    - If the number doesn't have an integer square root, set the value of *ptr to -1 to indicate an invalid square root.

Your function must be declared as follows:
    void ft_sqrt(int *ptr, int number);
