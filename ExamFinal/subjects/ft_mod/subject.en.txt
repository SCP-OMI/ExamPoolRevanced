Write a function that takes two parameters:

First: a pointer to an integer (int *ptr).
Second: an integer (int number).

This function updates the contents of the pointer by calculating the remainder of the value pointed to by ptr after 
dividing it by the integer received as the second parameter.

    - If number is zero, the function must not modify ptr.

Your function must be declared as follows:

void ft_mod(int *ptr, int number);
