Write a program to convert a number from decimal to binary.

If the number of arguments is not 1, display only a newline.

Explanation:
Decimal to binary conversion involves representing a base-10 number using only 0s and 1s (base-2).
The process works by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainders:

1. Divide the decimal number by 2
2. Record the remainder (this will be 0 or 1)
3. Continue dividing the quotient by 2 until it becomes 0
4. The binary number is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order

Example conversion for 5:
5 รท 2 = 2 remainder 1
2 รท 2 = 1 remainder 0
1 รท 2 = 0 remainder 1

Reading remainders in reverse: 101



Examples:
$>./decimal_to_binary "2" | cat -e
10$
$>./decimal_to_binary "5" | cat -e
101$
$>./decimal_to_binary "545" | cat -e
1000100001$
$>./decimal_to_binary "" | cat -e
